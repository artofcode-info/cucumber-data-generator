### Added
* [Issue 4 - Creating a dedicate spring module](https://github.com/artofcode-info/cucumber-data-generator/issues/4) - Added the DataProcessor for properties. The name of the processor is `SpringEnvironmentDataGenerator` and is reading data from properties base on following format : `env(test.value.from.property)` where `test.value.from.property` it's an actual property values that needs to be replaced.
